# Policy

Surge can forward requests to another proxy server or connect to the host directly, depending on customized rules. A policy indicates how Surge will deal with the requests.

There are 3 types of policies: [proxy](/policy/proxy.md), [policy group](/policy/group.md) and [bulit-in policy](/policy/built-in.md).
