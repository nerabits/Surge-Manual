# Local DNS Mapping

Surge supports local-customized DNS mapping. It's equivalent to /etc/hosts, but with more powerful features, including wildcard, alias, and assigning DNS server.

```
[Host]
abc.com = 1.2.3.4
*.dev = 6.7.8.9
foo.com = bar.com
bar.com = server:8.8.8.8
```

## Wildcard

You can use \* prefix to wildcard all sub-domains. Please note that Surge uses a simple string match. For example, \*google.com will match google.com, foo.google.com, and bargoogle.com. And \*.google.com will **not** match google.com.

```
[Host]
*.dev = 6.7.8.9
```

## Alias

It's equivalent to a CNAME record.

```
[Host]
foo.com = bar.com
```

## Assigning DNS Server

You can assign a specified DNS server to one or more domains.

```
[Host]
bar.com = server:8.8.8.8
```

Since Surge has its own DNS client implementation, some hostnames may fail to resolve. You can use 'server:system' to let the system handle the lookup.

```
[Host]
Macbook = server:system
```

By default, all hostnames with the suffix '.local' will be resolved by the system.

## Combined Usage

All features can be used together. For example:

```
[Host]
*.dev = foo.com
*.bar.com = server:system
```
