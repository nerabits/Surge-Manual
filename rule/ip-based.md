# IP-based Rule

There are 2 IP-based rule types. A IP-based rule will trigger a DNS lookup if the hostname of the request is a domain. If the DNS lookup fails, Surge will abort the rule testing and report an error.

#### IP-CIDR

```
IP-CIDR,192.168.0.0/16,DIRECT
IP-CIDR,10.0.0.0/8,DIRECT
IP-CIDR,172.16.0.0/12,DIRECT
IP-CIDR,127.0.0.1/8,DIRECT
```

Rule matches if the IP address of the request matches a specified range.

#### GEOIP

`GEOIP,US,DIRECT`

Rule matches if the GeoIP test result matches a specified country code.

### IP-based Rule Option
#### Option: no-resolve

```
GEOIP,US,DIRECT,no-resolve
IP-CIDR,172.16.0.0/12,DIRECT,no-resolve
```

When a GEOIP or IP-CIDR rule is encountered, Surge will send a DNS query to check if the hostname of request is a domain. You can select 'no-resolve' option to skip this rule for a request with domain.

> Notice: If some domains can't be resolved by local DNS server, please make sure there is no IP-based rule in front of the rule which matches that domain. Otherwise the rule testing will fail due to a DNS error. You can use 'no-resolve' to solve the issue too.
