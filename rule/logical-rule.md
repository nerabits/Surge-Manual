# Logical Rule

Use logical operator rule to combine multiple rules for complex scenarios. You may include logical rule in another logical rule.


#### AND Rule

Rule matches if all sub-rules match.

`AND,((#Rule1), (#Rule2), (#Rule3)...),Policy`

Example:
```
AND,((SRC-IP,192.168.1.110), (DOMAIN, example.com)),DIRECT
```

#### OR Rule

Rule matches if any sub-rule matches.

`OR,((#Rule1), (#Rule2), (#Rule3)...),Policy`

Example:
```
OR,((SRC-IP,192.168.1.110), (SRC-IP,192.168.1.111)),DIRECT
```

#### NOT Rule

Reverse the evaluation result of the original rule. 

`NOT,((#Rule1)),Policy`


Example:
```
AND,(NOT((SRC-IP,192.168.1.110)), (DOMAIN, example.com)),DIRECT
```
