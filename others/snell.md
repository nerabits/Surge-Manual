# Snell Protocol {{book.BETA}}

Snell is a lean encrypted proxy protocol developed by our team. Here are some highlights:

- Extreme performance.
- Support UDP over TCP relay.
- Single binary with zero dependencies. (except glibc)
- A wizard to help you start.
- Proxy server will report remote errors to the client if an error encounters. Clients may choose countermeasures for different scenarios.

> The Snell protocol is intended for Surge users only. Please do not reverse-analyze the protocol and make a compatible client of it. We want to keep the user base as small as possible, thanks for understanding.
