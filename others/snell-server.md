# Snell Server

Snell is a new encrypted proxy protocol developed by our team. You can download the standalone server binary from: https://github.com/surge-networks/snell

You may also use Surge Mac as a Snell proxy server (Starts from version 3.1.0).  Add the following lines to your profile.

```
[Snell Server]
interface = 0.0.0.0
port = 6160
psk = RANDOM_KEY_HERE
obfs = off
```

The embedded Snell server in Surge uses the Snell V1 protocol.
