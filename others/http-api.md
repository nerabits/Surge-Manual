# HTTP API

Starts from Surge iOS 4.4.0 and Surge Mac 4.0.0. You may use HTTP API to control Surge.

## Configuration

```
[General]
http-api = examplekey@0.0.0.0:6171
```

## Authentication

The API key must be filled in the 'X-Key' header for all requests.

```
GET /v1/events
X-Key: examplekey
Accept: */*
```

## Basic Constraints

Only HTTP without TLS is supported currently. Surge only uses GET and POST methods.

* For GET method, you should use URL queries to send parameters.
* For POST method, you should use JSON body to send parameters.

Surge will always return a JSON body as a response.
