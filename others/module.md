# Module

Module is a set of settings to override the current profile. You may use modules to:

- Tweak settings in a non-editable profile, such as managed profile and enterprise profile.
- Change part of settings with one tap. For example, you may use a module to enable MitM for all hostnames and adjust the filter temporarily.
- Use a module written by others to accomplish a particular task. For example, your co-work may share with you a module that rewrites the API requests to a test server.
- When you share one profile among devices, some settings might need modifying for different scenarios. The enabling state of modules won't be synced to other devices, so you can use a module to fulfill.

### Basic Concepts

A module is like a patch to the current profile. The settings of modules have a higher priority than the settings of the profile.

There are 3 types of modules:

- Internal Modules: Provided by Surge itself.
- Local Modules: .sgmodule files placed in the profile directory.
- Installed Modules: Modules installed with a URL.

### Write a Module

The syntax of a module is the same as the profile. You are allowed to override these sections:

* General, Replica, MITM
  * Override: `key = value`
  * Append to the original value: `key = %APPEND% value`
  * Insert in the front of the original value: `key = %INSERT% value`

	You can manipulate the 'hostname' field only in a MITM section.


* Rule, Script, URL Rewrite, Header Rewrite, Host

	The new lines will be inserted at the top of the original content.
	
	The rules in a module can only use internal policies: DIRECT, REJECT, and REJECT-TINYGIF.

* Metadata

	You may add metadata in a module file:
	
	```
	#!name=Name Here
	#!desc=Description Here
	```
	
	You may limit a module to specified platform. (Optional)
	
	```
	#!system=mac
	```

### Examples:

```
#!name=MitM All Hostnames
#!desc=Perform MitM on all hostnames with port 443, except those to Apple and other common sites which can't be inspected. You still need to configure a CA certificate and enable the main switch of MitM.

[MITM]
hostname = -*.apple.com, -*.icloud.com, -*.mzstatic.com, -*.crashlytics.com, -*.facebook.com, -*.instagram.com, *
```

```
#!name=Game Console SNAT
#!desc=Let Surge handle SNAT conversation properly for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Only useful if Surge Mac acts the router for these devices.
#!system=mac
[General]
always-real-ip = %APPEND% *.srv.nintendo.net, *.stun.playstation.net, xbox.*.microsoft.com, *.xboxlive.com
```
