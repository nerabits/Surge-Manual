### Version 4.0.5

#### Policy Group
In this release, we completely refactored the policy group functionality, bringing the following changes: 
1. The url-test/fallback/load-balance policy group can no longer be configured with a specific testing URL but with a global testing URL or a policy-configured testing URL. The policy's test results can be used directly in all policy group decisions, eliminating the need to retest each policy group individually.
2. All types of policy groups support mixed nesting. The only requirement is that no circular references can be used.
3. When a group policy is used as a sub-policy of the url-test/fallback/load-balance group.
    - The latency of the select/url-test/fallback/ssid group is the latency of the selected policy.
    - The latency of the load-balance group is the average of the latencies of all available policies.
4. The timeout parameter of a policy group marks policies with latency exceeding this parameter as unavailable when making decisions for the group. But the maximum time taken to test the policy group is controlled by the global test-timeout parameter. (Default is 5s)
5. When testing a group due to decision making, all sub-policies that the group may use are tested, including sub-policies of the sub-policy group.
6. You may use no-alert=true parameter to suppress notifications for particular groups.

#### Cloud Notification
You can receive the notifications on iOS devices. Enable this option first and then configure it on Surge iOS. The two device must use a same iCloud account.

#### Minor Changes
- Bug fixes.

* The name of WiFi can be an SSID, a BSSID, or a gateway IP address.
* No UI configuration in the current version.

#### REJECT-DROP
* REJECT-DROP policy is now effective to proxy connections. The connections matched with a REJECT-DROP policy will be closed in 60-120s later without any data returned.

#### Global Proxy
* You may now select and view sub-policy for policy groups while using the global proxy mode.

https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v3/Surge-3.5.2-1082.zip

### Version 3.5.1

#### New rule type: DOMAIN-SET
* DOMAIN-SET is just like RULE-SET. But it is designed a large number of rules and highly efficient.
* Unlike RULE-SET, you can only write hostnames (domain or IP address) in it. One hostname per line.
* You may use "." prefix to include all sub-domains.

#### Changes in SRC-IP
* SRC-IP rule now supports IP-CIDR for both IPv4 and IPv6.
          
#### Changes in DNS over HTTPS
* From this version, if DNS-over-HTTPS is configured, the traditional DNS will only be used to test the connectivity and resolve the domain in the DOH URL.
* The DNS over HTTPS now has a separate parameter: doh-server. The DOH servers in 'dns-server' will be moved to the new parameter after saving.
* The legacy DNS is always required now.
* DOH can be matched with rule 'PROTOCOL,DOH' now.
* Added a new parameter 'doh-follow-outbound-mode'. In the previous version, the DOH client follows the system proxy settings. From this version, all DOH requests will use DIRECT policy by default. If 'doh-follow-outbound-mode' is set, the DOH requests will follow the outbound mode settings regardless of the system proxy settings.
* We are refactoring the HTTP client for DOH and scripting. Please feedback if you encounter any issue.

#### Changes in Scripting
* Added a simple view to test the script. You may find it in the Window menu.

#### Minor Changes
* Fixed a crash in Dashboard while using search.
* Bug fixes.

https://dl.nssurge.com/mac/v3/Surge-3.3.2-925.zip

### Version 3.3.1
